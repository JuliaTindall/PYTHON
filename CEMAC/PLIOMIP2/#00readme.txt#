4/7/2019  regrid_ocn.py was used to regrid the SAT, PR, SST from the original 11 models.  An earlier version regrid_all.py was only used for atmospheric fields - this has now been moved to 'old'

4/7/2019 regrid_ocn_tripolar.py  was used to regrid some of the tripolar fields onto a rectilinear grid.  Please note that after regrid_ocn_tripolar.py has been run, we will then need to run regrid_ocn.py to calculate all the averages.
