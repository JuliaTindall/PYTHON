BIOME4
=======

We would like to run BIOME4 against our HadGEM data.  However the BIOME4 inputs come from the database and I am not convinced that the database is correct for HadGEM.

What we will here do is make some files which look like database files for HadGEM but we will do this from first principles in order to make sure they are correct.


OTHER FIELDS FOR VARIOUS PROCESSES

Dan's energy balance code

Field201 - TOA upward shortwave radiation: Outgoing sw rad flux (toa)
Field200 - TOA downward shortwave radiation:  (incoming sw rad flux (toa): all tss
Field207 - clear-sky TOA upwards shortwave radiation: clear-sky (II) upward sw flux (toa)
ilr - surface downward longwave; downward lw rad flux: surface
olr - TOA upward longwave radiation: outgoing lw rad flux (toa)
csolr - clear-sky TOA upward longwave: clear-sky (ii) upward lw flux (toa)
